Rules
------
- Twitter tags (hashtags and mentions) that meet some criteria get assigned a user-defined tag type (e.g. 'video-name' and 'video-nominee')
    Is rules interface too complicated? Maybe just a drag-and-drop, admin screen where
    tags get assigned paths and use drag-and-drop to prioritize, e.g. video-name > hashtag.
- Tweet creation triggers node creation (e.g. create Video Nominee node)
    -> tokens to be made available for action: URLs, hashtags, mentions, original tweet
    -> map tokens to fields
- Assign Twitter tags path alias according to tag type (could this be handled 
  by hooking into PathAuto somehow?)

Path Auto
--------
- Assign twitter tag path according to tag type(?) Or is this a Rules project?

Content Types
-------------
Tweet nomination or Video Nominee should contain a node reference to the other.

Field Widgets
--------------
- tweet widget: apply tweet processing from hook_node_presave() to user-defined text field (not just original tweet field)
