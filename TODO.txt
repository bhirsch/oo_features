Apps
- Video Tweet

Vote API Integration
- enable voting on Tweets through website
- enable voting on Tweets through Twitter
- visualization (Five Star? other?)

Exportable Twitter Feed Settings
- store feed URL and name of content type
- (re-)create feed nodes on command

Facebook 
- status/video nominations etc.
- events

Context: Taxonomy Tag Type
- Make a context for taxonomy tag type
- E.g. on taxonomy/term/tid if it's a video category -> [action/block/etc.]

Documentation
-------------
- hooks in twitter_tweet

Make _alter hooks proper drupal_alter() functions.

Rules
------
- Twitter tags (hashtags and mentions) that meet some criteria get assigned a user-defined tag type (e.g. 'video-name' and 'video-nominee')
    Is rules interface too complicated? Maybe just a drag-and-drop, admin screen where
    tags get assigned paths and use drag-and-drop to prioritize, e.g. video-name > hashtag.
- Tweet creation triggers node creation (e.g. create Video Nominee node)
    -> tokens to be made available for action: URLs, hashtags, mentions, original tweet
    -> map tokens to fields
- Assign Twitter tags path alias according to tag type (could this be handled 
  by hooking into PathAuto somehow?)

Path Auto
--------
- Assign twitter tag path according to tag type(?) Or is this a Rules project?

Content Types
-------------
- Tweet nomination or Video Nominee should contain a node reference to the other.

Field Widgets
--------------
- tweet widget: apply tweet processing from hook_node_presave() to user-defined text field (not just original tweet field)

Queries
-------
Replace db_query() with PDO style queries.


PLATFORM

Video Tweet Module
-------------------
- Add video_url field to tweet. Automatically detect video url inside tweet, then add URL to video_url:video_filter field
