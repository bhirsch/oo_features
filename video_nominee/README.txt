Nominations must:
- include the word "nominate" or "nomination"
- include the mention "@onlineoscars"
- only include one video name
- new nominations must include a valid url to the video (short urls are fine) as first
  URL in the tweet

Nominations may:
- include categories (between category/categories and '.' or end)

video name: 
- Video name is assigned by a valid nomination tweet.
- Video name is the only hashtag in the first sentence of the tweet.

video category:
- Video categories must...
--- include "category" or "categories"
--- categories must be listed as hashtags between "category" and "."
--- end with a period, e.g. "categories: #one #two #three."
- To add categories to an existing video nominee, tweet must say
  "Add category:" or "Add categories:"
