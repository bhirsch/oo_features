Twitter video nominations must follow this pattern: 

@onlineoscars nomination: #video_name http://something.com/video/url.
example: 
@onlineoscars nomination: #battle_at_kruger http://bit.ly/uec9. 

OR 

@onlineoscars nomination: #video_name http://something.com/video/url. Categories: #one #two #etc.
example: 
@onlineoscars nomination: #battle_at_kruger http://bit.ly/uec9. Categories: #action #adventure #drama.

Nominations must:
- begin with "@onlineoscars nomination:"
- include a unique video name
- include a valid url to the video (short urls are fine)
- end with a period

video name: 
- Video name is assigned by a valid nomination tweet
- Video name must be unique
- Video name immediately follows the text: "@onlineoscars nomination:"

video category:
- Video categories must...
--- immediately follow the text: "categories:" 
--- be preceded by a space, e.g. "categories: #one #two #etc."
--- end with a period, e.g. "categories: #one #two #three."
@todo make this less fragile. For example, this wouldn't work: 
 "...blah blah blah.categories:#one, #two,#three."
